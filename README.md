# My-Six-Month_Plan
My Six Month Plan is a conscious effort to become a competent and valuable asset to my future employers. I have the perfect quote to keep me motivated, and it is from my favorite movie director, James Cameron - â€œIf you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success." That is exactly what I will do!
