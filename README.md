# My-Six-Month_Plan
My Six Month Plan is a conscious effort to become a competent and valuable asset to my future employers. I have the perfect quote to keep me motivated, and it is from my favorite movie director, James Cameron - â€œIf you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success." That is exactly what I will do!

## This is my life in Six Months
I have a smile on my face. I know that I have given my best in my projects and my responsibilites and my exams. Yes, my exams. Why? Now, I stand at the sweet spot of 8.6 CGPA and have earned my 99th percentile in GRE (one step closer to being part of Stanford's 2024 cohort)
